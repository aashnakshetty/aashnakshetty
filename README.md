- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aashnakshetty
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things like Music, Books, Art, Writing, Painting, Video Making 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science because I'm passionate to keep making applications infused with AI because it gives me a feeling of being a scientist (an inventor of things!)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Well I am a huge Sabrina, Selena, Shawn and Taylor fan. Also I like reading Harry Potter and fantasical books. I have also written a book. Besides that I am quite active on my youtube channels (making covers, cooking, vlogging) and like making animations on scratch and writing songs, stories and poems. Basically I am an artist :)
- ðŸ’» Data Science Pursuits: I like working with HTML, CSS, JS and NLP and implementing AI bots into my projects
